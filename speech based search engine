# Speech-Based Search Engine

This Python script allows users to perform a Google search using their voice. It leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user in a hands-free way.

## Features

* Captures voice input through the microphone.
* Converts spoken words to text using Google Speech Recognition.
* Opens a web browser to show search results based on the spoken query.
* Responds to the user using text-to-speech.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> **Note**: Installing `pyaudio` might require additional setup depending on your operating system.

## How It Works

1. The script initializes a text-to-speech engine.
2. It prompts the user with audio: *"What do you want to search for?"*
3. It listens to the user's speech input via the microphone.
4. Converts the speech to text using Google's speech recognition API.
5. Opens a Google search in the default web browser using the recognized text.

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python speech\ based\ search\ engine.py
```

Speak clearly into the microphone when prompted. If the speech is recognized correctly, your default browser will open a Google search with the spoken query.

## Limitations

* Requires internet access for Google Speech Recognition.
* May not recognize unclear or heavily accented speech accurately.
* Handles only a single query at a time.

## File Summary

* `speech based search engine.py`: The main Python script that runs the speech-based search process.
